# ‚úàÔ∏è Demo 2: Vacation Planner (Conversational AI)

## üìò Overview

This LangGraph Studio project demonstrates an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline and automate the process of vacation planning. The agent intelligently gathers information about weather, activities, and flights, formulates a detailed trip plan, and presents it to the user. This project showcases the power of AI agents, tool usage, and iterative workflows in a real-world scenario, making it an excellent demonstration for presentations on Agent and Tool calls and iterative workflow capabilities. This demo requires a LangSmith Login.

> Please plan a trip to Paris, France for 5 days with my family in August.  We will be leaving from San Joes, CA

## üéØ System Prompt & Agent Behavior

The vacation planner operates using a carefully crafted system prompt that defines its role, workflow, and constraints. This prompt serves as the foundational instruction set that guides the AI agent through the vacation planning process.

### Core Prompt Structure

```python
system_prompt = """You are a helpful vacation planning assistant.
Your goal is to help the user plan their trip based on their request.
The user will provide a destination, a start time (which might be relative, like 'in 10 days'), and a duration (e.g., 'for 5 days').
To fulfill the request, you MUST use the available tools in the following order:
1. First, use the 'WeatherSearch' tool to find the weather forecast for the destination around the specified start date.
2. Second, use the 'ActivitySearch' tool to find potential things to do or sights to see at the destination suitable for the trip's duration.
3. Third, use the 'FlightSearch' tool to find information about available flights to the destination around the specified start date.
IMPORTANT: You must call the tools ONE AT A TIME in the specified order. Wait for the result of one tool call before making the next one.
Once you have gathered information from all three tools, synthesize the results into a comprehensive plan for the user.
!Important: Only provide information that pertains to planning this trip.  No other topics should be referenced.
"""
```

### Prompt Design Principles

The system prompt is engineered with several key design principles:

**1. Clear Role Definition**
- Establishes the agent as a "helpful vacation planning assistant"
- Sets clear boundaries on the assistant's scope and purpose

**2. Structured Workflow Enforcement**
- Mandates a specific three-step tool execution sequence
- Prevents parallel tool calls to ensure proper data gathering flow
- Creates predictable, reproducible planning sessions

**3. Input Parameter Specification**
- Explicitly defines expected user inputs (destination, start time, duration)
- Accommodates flexible time formats ("in 10 days" vs. specific dates)
- Provides clear examples for user guidance

**4. Tool Usage Constraints**
- Enforces sequential tool execution with explicit waiting periods
- Prevents workflow deviation that could lead to incomplete planning
- Ensures comprehensive data collection before synthesis

**5. Output Focus & Boundaries**
- Restricts responses to trip-relevant information only
- Prevents scope creep into unrelated topics
- Maintains professional, focused interactions

### Workflow Control Mechanisms

The prompt works in conjunction with the graph architecture to control agent behavior:

- **Sequential Processing:** The "ONE AT A TIME" instruction prevents race conditions and ensures data dependencies are respected
- **State Management:** Each tool result informs the next step, building comprehensive trip context
- **Synthesis Requirement:** Forces the agent to combine all gathered data into a cohesive plan rather than presenting raw tool outputs

### Prompt Evolution & Customization

This prompt structure can be easily modified to accommodate different planning scenarios:

- **Specialty Travel:** Add specific tool calls for business travel, adventure trips, or family vacations
- **Extended Planning:** Include additional tools for accommodation, restaurant reservations, or local transportation
- **Personalization:** Incorporate user preference parameters for budget, activity types, or accommodation standards

## ‚ú® Features & Functions

This assistant leverages a stateful graph defined in `agent.py` to manage a multi-step workflow. It interacts with external services via tools defined in `tools.py` and is guided by a sophisticated system prompt and logic within `nodes.py`.

1.  **Intelligent Agent Core (`nodes.py`, `agent.py`):**

    *   **Iterative Processing:** The agent operates in a loop. It calls tools, processes their outputs, and the `should_continue` function (in `nodes.py`) determines the next step in the workflow. This allows for a dynamic, responsive process.
    *   **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** Utilizes a Large Language Model (configurable for "anthropic" or "openai" as per `GraphConfig` in `agent.py`) to understand instructions from the `system_prompt`, process information from tools, and make planning decisions.
    *   **State Management (`state.py`):** Employs `AgentState` to maintain the conversation history (`messages`) as the process unfolds.
    *   **System Prompt Driven Behavior (`nodes.py`):** A detailed `system_prompt` guides the agent through a specific sequence of operations, defines critical rules, and specifies the desired output format for the vacation plan.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        Agent-->Weather_Action;
        Agent-->Activity_Action;
        Agent-->Flight_Action;
        Weather_Action-->Agent;
        Activity_Action-->Agent;
        Flight_Action-->Agent;
    ```

2.  **Workflow Steps & Tool Integration:**

    *   **Step 1: Weather Search (`WeatherSearch` tool):**
        *   The workflow begins with the agent node, which, guided by the `system_prompt`, determines the need to call the `WeatherSearch` tool.
        *   **Functionality:** This tool (defined in `tools.py/search_weather()`) uses Tavily Search to find weather forecasts for a specific location and time.
        *   **Graph Node:** `weather_action` in `agent.py`.

    *   **Step 2: Activity Search (`ActivitySearch` tool):**
        *   After receiving the weather information, the agent calls the `ActivitySearch` tool.
        *   **Functionality:** This tool (defined in `tools.py/search_activities()`) uses Tavily Search to find activities, attractions, or things to do in a specific location.
        *   **Graph Node:** `activity_action` in `agent.py`.

    *   **Step 3: Flight Search (`FlightSearch` tool):**
        *   After gathering activity information, the agent calls the `FlightSearch` tool.
        *   **Functionality:** This tool (defined in `tools.py/search_flights()`) uses Tavily Search to find flight information to a specific location around a certain time.
        *   **Graph Node:** `flight_action` in `agent.py`.

    *   **Step 4: AI-Driven Plan Creation (Agent Reasoning):**
        *   As mandated by the `system_prompt` (in `nodes.py`), the agent performs an in-depth analysis of the combined data from the `WeatherSearch`, `ActivitySearch`, and `FlightSearch` tools. This critical step utilizes the LLM's reasoning capabilities, not a separate tool.
        *   **Analysis includes:**
            *   Synthesizing weather information to suggest appropriate clothing or gear.
            *   Identifying potential activities based on the trip's duration and the user's interests.
            *   Providing flight options and estimated costs.
        *   **Output:** The agent formulates a structured, comprehensive vacation plan.

3.  **Critical Operational Rules & Workflow Control (enforced by `system_prompt` and graph logic):**

    *   The `add_conditional_edges` in `agent.py` uses the `should_continue` function to route the workflow based on the last tool called or to end the process.
    *   Edges then route back from tool actions to the agent node, enabling the iterative nature of the workflow.
    *   The agent is instructed to call the tools ONE AT A TIME in the specified order.
